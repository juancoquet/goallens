# Goal Lens

A prediction model for Europe's top 5 football leagues.

Goal Lens uses data from 2017 onwards, for all top-flight matches in England, Spain, France, Italy and Germany. That's more than 9,000 fixtures which the model uses to learn from.

Many different prediciton strategies have been put to the test on historical data to improve the accuracy of the model. Strategies were refined iteratively to dial in paramaters that improve the quality of predictions generated.

Goal Lens scrapes xG data daily and uses it to generate predictions for upcoming football games. It is still a work in progress, with new features planned to improve the accuracy of predictions.

Built using Python, Django, Docker, Pandas, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.
